          <p>
            When you declare a variable with <code>var</code> keyword, it is
            declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function. The
            <code>let</code> keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra
            features. When you declare a variable with the
            <code>let</code> keyword inside a block, statement, or expression,
            its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.

          <h2>Mutate an Array Declared with <code>const</code> Keywords</h2>
          <p>
            Some developers prefer to assign all their variables using
            <code>const</code> by default, unless they know they will need to
            reassign the value. Only in that case, they use <code>let</code>.
            However, it is important to understand that objects (including
            arrays and functions) assigned to a variable using
            <code>const</code> are still mutable. Using the
            <code>const</code> declaration only prevents reassignment of the
            variable identifier.
